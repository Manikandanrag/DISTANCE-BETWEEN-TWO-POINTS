# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Import numpy module to use built-in functions
### Step 2: 
et lists from the linear equations and assign it to np.array
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: 
Print the result.
### Step 5: 
end the program.
### PROGRAM:
```

x1=10
x2=4
y1=6
y2=2
d=((x2-x1)**2+(y2-y1)**2)**0.5
c=round(d,2)
print(c)
```
  


### OUTPUT:
![mani ](https://github.com/Manikandanrag/DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS/assets/138849491/41e8cca1-704d-41d3-a060-33e2f97ea361)



### RESULT:
Thus the distance between the two points is successfully obtained.
